# Young Physicists' Symposium

The Physics Club Phi@I of Indian Institute of Science and Research, Mohali is organising the first (and hopefully not last) Undergraduate Physics Symposium - Young Physicists' Symposium in collaboration with the Turing Club.

There are lots of conferences/symposiums held globally, but none of them are primarily organised for the undergraduate students, and therefore is difficult for the undergraduate students to compete with the PhDs and Faculty to give talks on the research they carry out in their summer projects. Talking to various undergraduates from our own community, who have carried out really interesting projects, it seems like a conference like this would be a great chance to communicate their research. 

This event has been planned to encourage the undergraduate students of all basic science sister institutes (IISERs/IISc/NISER/CBS) to come together and participate in learning about the research carried out by the other undergraduate researchers, and to provide a platform to talk about their common interests. 

We can only make this successful (so to get nice funding for the next time and make it an annual thing) if you all participate. We don't expect you to solve the quantum theory of gravity to present at the conference, nor do we expect highly original results published in Nature Physics. We just expect some passion to talk about the topics you love, just send us an abstract.  

## Event Details 
The symposium is going to be held from 26th-30th December 2020 (if this year permits)
The registrations for the speakers will close on 23rd December 2020. For the other participants, registrations will remain open till 30th December. 
Each day will include speakers from a particular field of physics - Astrophysics and Cosmology, Quantum Information and Quantum Computing, Condensed matter physics, High Energy Physics and Computational Research/Interdisciplinary.   
We aim to have 5 undergraduate speakers each day, and one keynote speaker for each day


## About IISER Mohali

Established in 2007, the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER), Mohali, is one of the seven pioneer institutes set up by the Ministry of Human Resource Development (MHRD), Government of India, with the intent of becoming the IITs of pure sciences. Over the past ten years, IISER Mohali has been ranked as one of the top research institutions in the country, and having one of the highest research throughput in science in the nation.
