# The Young Physicists' Symposium Website

The first (and hopefully not last) Undergraduate Physics Symposium - Young Physicists' Symposium

See [local build instructions](lbi.md) if changing template etc

For only content changes,

1. index.md - Introduction
2. program.md - Autogenerated, do not edit
3. registered.md - Autogenerated, do not edit
4. registration.md - Registration rules and links
5. contact.md - Contact Us

For rebuilding registered.md and registration.md, 
1. update `abstracts/topic` to have a file name as the name of the speaker with content as the abstract of talk
2. Edit `_programtable.md` to edit the table. 
3. Add registered participants to `_registerednames.md` to have a list of names
